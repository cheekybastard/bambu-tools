Installation
============

Bambu Tools is available in pieces (by checking out the source code) or as a
whole package, via a package manager.

Installing from PyPi
--------------------

Just run::
	
	pip install bambu-tools

And that'll get you the whole lot.

Installing from source
----------------------
	
The source code is available from GitHub. To install it::
	
	git clone https://github.com/mrmarksteadman/bambu-tools.git
	cd bambu-tools
	python setup.py install

Installing separate packages
----------------------------

I haven't yet found a sensible way of providing a setup script for each
package within Bambu Tools that keeps the whole thing manageable, so do
`contact me
<http://marksteadman.com/>`_ if you have any thoughts.
